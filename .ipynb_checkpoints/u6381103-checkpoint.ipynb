    "1. You will develop a better understanding of indexing, including the tokeniser, parser, and normaliser components, and how to improve the search performance given a predefined evaluation metric, \n",
    "2. You will develop a better understanding of search algorithms, and how to obtain better search results, and \n",
    "3. You will find the best way to combine an indexer and search algorithm to maximise your performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will solve five programming questions, and three written questions. \n",

    "We will check the correctness of your code and the overall performance score.\n",

After the execution of each block is finished, inspect the output, save the notebook and shutdown the kernel.
